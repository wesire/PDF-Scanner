Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data. It has become increasingly important in modern technology.

Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These networks can learn complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data.

Applications of Machine Learning

Machine learning has numerous applications across various domains:

1. Computer Vision: Image recognition, object detection, facial recognition
2. Natural Language Processing: Text analysis, sentiment analysis, language translation
3. Recommendation Systems: Product recommendations, content suggestions
4. Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, drug discovery, medical imaging analysis
5. Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, risk assessment

The field continues to evolve with new techniques and architectures being developed regularly.
