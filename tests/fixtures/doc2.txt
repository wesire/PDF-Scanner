Natural Language Processing Overview

Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics.

Key Concepts in NLP

Text preprocessing is essential in NLP. This includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removing stop words. These steps help prepare text data for analysis and modeling.

Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture semantic meaning. Popular embedding methods include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. These embeddings allow models to understand word relationships and context.

Applications and Use Cases

NLP powers many everyday applications:
- Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa
- Machine translation services
- Sentiment analysis for customer feedback
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Text summarization and generation

The field has seen tremendous growth with the advent of transformer models like BERT and GPT.
