Computer Vision and Image Processing

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos, machines can accurately identify and classify objects.

Image Classification

Image classification involves assigning a label to an entire image. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the primary architecture used for this task. CNNs can automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from images.

Object Detection

Object detection goes beyond classification by identifying and locating multiple objects within an image. Popular algorithms include YOLO (You Only Look Once), R-CNN, and Fast R-CNN.

Practical Applications

Computer vision is used in:
- Autonomous vehicles for navigation and obstacle detection
- Medical imaging for disease detection
- Facial recognition systems
- Quality control in manufacturing
- Augmented reality applications

The technology continues to improve with better algorithms and increased computing power.
